# Summary

In summary, we gathered data for the temperatures in June and December which are polar opporiste months from each other. June is a month that is in the summer season and we can see that the temepratures are have conformatble leveles not too hot and too cold. The average rain that we recieved in this month is very low, which some days having no rain but then having odd days with 4 inches of rain. Decmeber in the other hand has can be a colder month with the lowest temeprature been 56 degrees farenheitbut its highest temperature of 83 dregrees farenheit which is not too far apart from June's. The percipirtaion in December is also ideal, there will be days with no rain, but their will de odd days with high chance of rain with a max of 6.42 inches of rain. 

In summary, we can recommend W. Avy to have their Surf Up ice crema shop open all year round and that is because the weather will be in ideal tropical range, with only the down factory that there maybe some heavy rain days specifically in December. But if you ask me ice cream can be enjoyed anytime of the year, rain or shine.
